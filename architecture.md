Building Blocks to profile OGC API and other standards to support Open Science. 

- Workflow Ontology to standardise reference to key workflow concepts
- Schemas to support OGC API and other JSON based implementations, binding to a common semantic framework.
- Metadata profiles capturing the contract with descriptions of specific aspects
- API profiles to bind the standardised schemas
