- title: The water bodies experiment with some provenance data attached
  content: |-
    This describes an execution of the water bodies example workflow included in the workflows EarthCODE
    bblock.

    Some notes:
      - The 'prov' property contains the provenance data because the current schemas won't allow it to
        be at the top level or inside `properties` due to a clash in the `type` field.
      - The wfprov:usedInput is nearer to a natural representation of the inputs than plain PROV's
        qualifiedUsage. However, there is no equivalent wfprov:generatedOutput, which makes it difficult
        to say that the output is a STAC Collection and that it was the stac_catalog output parameter.
        If you wish to track quality/fit metrics as you develop a workflow or product then a
        wfprov:producedOutput with a describedByParameter might have been useful.
      - hadMember for the stac_items parameter indicates that this is not a string literal input but an
        array of URIs for input entities.
      - The outputs being a child is required in EarthCODE but this constrains catalogue structure
        and results in STAC entities with multiple parents. It doesn't seem fundamentally necessary.
      - Very little runtime information is given, cwltool --provenance emits very little and wf4ever
        doesn't provide a way to represent it. eg, OS, total memory, etc, that are relevant to knowing
        if an experiment can feasibly be repeated.
