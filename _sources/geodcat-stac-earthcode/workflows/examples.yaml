- title: Polar Warp
  content: |
   The polarwarp algorithm geolocates, aligns, and warps satellite SAR images using forecast drift and wind/tide fields in polar regions. It takes ice drift vectors from multiple data sources (SAR, TOPAZ4, ICON, tide models), translates them into pixel displacements, and applies thin-plate spline warping to generate temporally aligned and drift-corrected imagery. This enables monitoring of sea ice motion over forecast windows while preserving georeferencing.

    The Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System (POLARIS) is a methodology to assess the risk posed to a ship by ice conditions in relation to the ship's assigned ice class. It uses the WMO standard sea ice charts as the basis for the calculation.

- title: Water Bodies Detection
  content: |-
    The water-bodies workflow determines possible areas of water within a given region using NDWI and Otsu threshold. These regions are marked on the generated GeoTIFF(s) and can then be viewed using an appropriate application.
    The primary workflow, water_bodies, returns a STAC Catalog containing the generated items and each output will have it's own STAC item. Multiple images can be processed at once as the workflow uses scatter functionality for parallel processing, if supported by the executing service.
    This workflow is borrowed from the EOEPCA examples
    There are two workflows defined in this CWL file, the first, detect_water_body, computes the output TIFF for a single input STAC item, and the second, water_bodies, calls the first workflow for any number of STAC items and also wraps the output in a STAC Catalog, to improve integration with other OGC services.
    The primary workflow accept the same parameters:
  
  
    stac_items - links to the Sentinel-2 COG STAC items containing GeoTIFF data you wish to process
  
    aoi - coordinates defining the area of interest we wish to crop the inputs to
  
    epsg - the coordinate system for the input data, to be used when cropping the input
  
    bands - the band names to use in the NDWI calculations
    The sub-workflow swaps stac_items for a single item input.
    The expected output from this workflow is a STAC Catalog of GeoTIFF items containing GeoTIFF files highlighting the regions of water in the input images, you will get a single image for each STAC item input.

- title: Water Bodies Detection With Provenance
  content: |-
    The Water Bodies Detection workflow record with mocked-up provenance data added to it.

    Some notes:
      - The 'prov' property contains the provenance data because the current schemas won't allow it to
        be at the top level or inside `properties` due to a clash in the `type` field.
      - The link to the CWL is there twice but it's not clear to me which type of link is better.
      - wf4ever and PROV say little about how inputs are described. This is based on OGC API Processes.
      - There's potential ambiguity over whether it's describing what arrived at the Processes API,
        what arrived at the workflow engine or a mix. eg, processing mode may not reach the engine and
        links may have been dereferenced. Or perhaps this is unimportant. However, both a link to CWL and
        a link to a Processes API process could be given in one record.

- title: Mangrove Detect
  content: |-
    The mangrove biomass workflow demonstrates an initial approach to estimating above-ground biomass and carbon stocks using Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery. This serves as a baseline workflow that can be augmented with complementary data sources depending on project needs. The current implementation queries the AWS STAC catalog for cloud-free scenes, calculates vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, SAVI), applies threshold-based classification to detect mangrove extent, and estimates biomass using a validated allometric equation from Myanmar field studies. Results include spatially explicit biomass maps, carbon stock totals, and CO2 equivalence calculations following IPCC Tier 2 methodology.
