## IPT Profile

The IPT profile supports canonical mechanisms for handling Integrity, Provenance and Trust.

Specifically this profile:

1. allows a client to nominate IRI identifier for the prov:Activity
2. allows a client to nominate IRI for the Process Service as an prov:Agent
3. allows a client to nominate an IRI for the result object
4. Defines how a provenance trace can be return by reference or inline in the result as a prov:Entity

These constraints are defined by specialisations of input and output descriptions.

Todo: define how the OpenAPI document refines the base.
