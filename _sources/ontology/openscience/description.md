## OpenScience Ontology

This is a placeholder for an "Open Science Ontology" supporting description of interoperable scientific workflows.

This ontology will be based on canonical common ontologies where appropriate, and be mapped to various implementing APIs and metadata standards as required to establish common semantics of elements appearing within a reproduceable and interoperable scientific workflow ecosystem.
